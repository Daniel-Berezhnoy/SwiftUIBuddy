# SwiftUIBuddy

SwiftUIBuddy is a collection of beautiful, easy-to-use components for your SwiftUI App. It contains custom Buttons, Pickers, Progress Views, Text Fields, and so much more! The components are highly customizable and built using 100% SwiftUI.

The library was designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It strives to resemble Apple's design style and follow Human Interface Guidelines.

To install, go to Xcode -> File -> Add Packages and paste https://github.com/Daniel-Berezhnoy/SwiftUIBuddy into the search bar. Confirm and install the Package. Now import SwiftUIBuddy in the file(s) you want to use it. The minimum deployment target is iOS 15.0.

This project is a work-in-progress, so expect it to grow, and feel free to contribute.
