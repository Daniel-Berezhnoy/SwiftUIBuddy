# SwiftUIBuddy

SwiftUIBuddy is a collection of beautiful easy-to-use components for your SwiftUI App. It contains custom Buttons, Pickers, Progress Views, Text Fields and so much more! All of the components are highly customizable and are built using 100% SwiftUI.

The library was designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It strives to resemble Apple's design style and follow Human Interface Guidelines.

To install, just go to Xcode -> File -> Add Packages and paste https://github.com/Daniel-Berezhnoy/SwiftUIBuddy into the search bar. Now import SwiftUIBuddy in the file(s) you want to use it. The minimum deployment target is iOS 15.0.

This project is a work-in-progress, so expect it to grow and feel free to contribute.
